# 2048 - Console Version
2048 is a  sliding block puzzle game . The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. 2048 is played on either a  4×4 or 3×3 grid in general, with numbered tiles that slide smoothly when a player moves them using the four arrow keys. Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of 4. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move. When the player has no legal moves (there are no empty spaces and no adjacent tiles with the same value), the game ends. The scoreboard at the top keeps record of high scores, number of moves. 
  
The main difference between the current version of 2048 and the one you are viewing is multiplayer feature. The reason to choose this project is being game enthusiast I want to explore the way of making games. By doing this mini project we can explore the algorithm part of game in depth. This game being done in C, though the UI may not be satisfying it would be fast and reliable. Here we have avoided implementing graphics as it is not a part of standard C library.
